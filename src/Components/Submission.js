          They sat across from each other, the space between them feeling
          heavier than it should. He stared at his hands, fingers tracing
          invisible patterns on the table, while she picked at a loose thread on
          her sleeve, pulling at it slowly, as if unraveling it would somehow
          make things easier. Her foot tapped lightly beneath the table, a
          rhythm she didn’t realize she had fallen into. His leg bounced ever so
          slightly, then stopped. He glanced at her, catching the way her lip
          trembled for just a second before she pressed it into a thin line. She
          met his gaze but looked away just as quickly, her fingers still
          tugging at the thread, now frayed and uneven. His throat tightened as
          he inhaled, ready to speak, but the words clung to his chest like a
          weight he couldn’t shake. Across from him, she shifted in her chair,
          arms crossing in front of her as if shielding herself from whatever
          might come next. The silence stretched, punctuated only by the faint
          creak of her chair as she leaned back, eyes drifting to the window.
          Outside, the world moved on. Inside, it felt like time had stopped,
          both of them trapped in their own thoughts, the things left unsaid
          swirling around them like an unspoken storm.
